Playgrounds have been integrated with the new build system in Xcode 12. It enables three main new capabilities:

- Playgrounds in Swift packages: we can use a playground to showcase and document our library API in a playground
- Playgrounds dependencies easy support: both Swift Packages and frameworks
- Playgrounds assets and resources support

## Using Xcode Playground with Frameworks and Packages Dependencies

- As long as the Playground and the package or framework are in the same workspace, we can make these dependencies available to the playground by enabling the Playground Settigns `Build Active Scheme` in the Playground Inspector.
- `Build Active Scheme` tells Xcode to automatically build all targets in the currently selected scheme and make any modules (frameworks/packages) importable to the Playground.
- New Playgrounds have this `Build Active Scheme` enabled by default.

## What Else is New in Playgrounds

- Playgrounds build logs are now available in the report navigator: you can see the dependency modules being built first, then the playground target itself.
- All resource types supported by the build system are now supported in Playgrounds, which means things such as Assets Catalogs and `.mlmodel`s are now supported.
