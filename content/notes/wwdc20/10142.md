## Architecting for sharing across apps
### App groups

- How To:
  1. Create and enable app groups in the `Signing & Capabilities` of your project(s) file in Xcode (add a new `App Groups` capability)
  2. Enable it in the developer portal

- App Groups enable sharing data via [`UserDefaults`][usDoc] (via a [shared suite][suiteDoc]) and shared files
  
### Build and use Swift packages

- Separate and focus concerns in different packages
- This makes it clear for new comers to understand the projects

- Suggested Package Candidates:
  - Authentication layer
  - Image fetching and caching
  - Design system
  - Application model layer
  - Barcode and text scanning, this gives a common look and feel for your bar code, QR and text recognition across each app.

## Testing your apps for reliability

- break down tests by importance, this allows you to run the most important tests more frequently than others. The more frequent they're run, the quicker you can catch any failures.
  
- test rendering performance
- test battery performance
- use [Instruments][19-411] to detect where your code pitfalls are

## Managing your app after production release with configurations
 
- server-side configurations allow you to have more flexibility and adaptability around the user experience in your application.
- the server can distribute different configurations based on geolocation, market, or even more narrower level.
- changing these attributes in production does not depend on any code changes.
- this provides a great flexibility where some features may not be used for certain locations, markets, or elsewhere
- configurations free up developer time from maintenance
- configurations can be used to force the user to update the app
