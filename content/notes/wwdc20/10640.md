## Adaptive Precision

 While on the mac the pointer gives you increased precision compared to touch. On iPad it's helpful to actually reduce the precision of the pointer to match the user interface.  

 This concept of dynamically adjusting the precision of the pointer to match the precision of the interface is called, **Adaptive Precision**.

 - A traditional pointer is drawn _over_ the entire interface often obscuring the control you're interacting with, the Ipad pointer lets you have the controls you're interacting with completely unobstructed: when the pointer snaps to a control, the pointer shifts from being in front of the app to being behind the buttons icon or label. 

 ## Two pointers

 When you move the pointer around on screen, you're actually moving two pointers: 
 - the one you see on screen
 - an invisible one, that tracks the true position of the pointer. 

The latter is called **Model pointer**: it is used to decide which item the pointer is hovering over and it takes advantage of the generous padding that buttons have on iPadOS to make them easier to tap with the finger. 

Once you lift your finger the pointer centers itself on the current active control, this is called **Recentering**.

When swiping, the iPad pointer can figure out which control you were aiming for and move there automatically: this is called **Magnetism**. Magnetism scans the interface to find the control you most likely want to target. 

## Pointer Effects

iPadOS provides three effects, and you can create your own as well
