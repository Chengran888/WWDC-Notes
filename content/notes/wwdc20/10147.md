- Xcode 12/Swift 5.3 adds SPM support for:
  - distribution to closed-source libraries 
  - binary dependencies

## How To Use a Binary Dependency in an App

- Supported only on Apple platforms
- Uses XCFrameworks
- It works exactly as a open source library, you add them in an app in the same way, you add them as a package dependency in the same way. 
- The difference is that, instead, of having the source code in the project navigator, we have an XCFramework (with, headers are still visible.

## How to Crete/Distribute a Binary Framework as a Swift Package

- With Swift 5.3 we have a new `Package` target called `.binaryTarget`, in here we provide the XCFramework module name, an https URL, and a verification checksum:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    products: [
        .library(name: "MyPackage", targets: ["MyPackage"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
    ],
    targets: [
        .binaryTarget(
            name: "MyPackage",
            url: "https://example.com/MyPackage/MyPackage-1.0.0.xcframework.zip",
            checksum: "6d988a1a27418674b4d7c31732f6d60e60734ceb11a0ce9b54d1871918d9c194"
        )
    ]
)
```

- We use the usual `products` api to vend the binary framework.
- To generate the `checksum` we can use the new `swift package compute-checksum` command:

```swift
swift package compute-checksum MyPackage-1.0.0.xcframework.zip
```

- For more information on how to create a binary, refer to the [`Binary Frameworks In Swift`][19-446] session.
