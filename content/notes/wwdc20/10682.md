## Tones

For this first challenge, a `SPCAudio` `PlaygroundModule` has been built, this module is part of the [Create Quest][createQuestDwl] Playground Book.

In this challenge you will need to play a tone with the secret code given in the previous quest. All of this is done via a `Timer` and a `SPCAudio`'s' `Tone`.
