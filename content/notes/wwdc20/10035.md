## Families

Three available families:

## Timelines

The [`IntentTimelineProvider`][itpdoc] is the engine of the widget.

When our `TimelineProvider` is asked to provide a [`Timeline`][tl], we also need to define our reload policy:

* `atEnd`: tells `WidgetKit` to request a new timeline only after the date of the last entry has passed
* `after(date: Date)`: tells `WidgetKit` to request a new timeline only after a specified date
* `Never`: tells `WidgetKit` to never request a new timeline, the app will let `WidgetKit` know when a new timeline is available

## Configuration

WidgetKit configuration is driven by SiriKit.

The core technology for configuration is custom [`INIntent`][intentsDoc]s.

For more refer to session [`Add configuration and intelligence to your widgets`][wwdc20-10194].

## Deep linking

Widgets do not have animation or custom interactions, but we can deep-link from our widget into our app:

- `.systemSmall` widgets are one large tap area
- `.systemMedium` and `.systemLarge` can use the new SwiftUI [`Link`][linkDoc] API to create tappable zones within the widget.
